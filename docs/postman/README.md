# Postman Tests

This folder contains a Postman collection and environment for the authentication endpoints defined in the OpenAPI specification. Import `auth_test_collection.json` along with `auth_environment.json` into Postman to run automated tests locally.

The environment uses `http://localhost:3000` as the default API base URL. Update the variables as needed before running the collection.
